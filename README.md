Ali Sadiq MS1 - Escape Leeds

This is the first project of my software development career. I have decided tocreate a website for an Escape Room company named Escape Leeds.
I will be using what I have learnt from modules covering HTML, CSS and the 
bootstrap framework. I am going to be attempting to show a wide range
of parts I have learnt, from forms to hovers. 

-UX-

The website is for the company Escape Leeds. They are a west yorkshire based Escape Room business. They currently have 3 sites in Leeds, which each have 3 
rooms available for players. 

The site owner's goal is to atrract customers and convince them to complete a booking with their escape rooms.

The website targets thrill seeeking individuals who are either new to the 
escape room experience or have done them before.

My project is the best way for the site owner to achieve their goal as it is 
simple but effective. 

I have produced an eye-catching homepage, attracting the viewers attention. 

I also have encorporated customer reviews, to give new customers an idea as to how brilliant the experience will be. 

A simple footer on each page providing the address to each location and an 
external link showing the exact location on google maps, gives the consumer an easy way to be able to find how to get there.

The footer also has links to the social media pages of the site owner, which 
encourages them to further explore the business.

Having visited many escape rooms myself, in many different countries, I have 
had exposure to a lot of websites.

With me being a big fan of the rooms, I know exactly what the consumer wants, making it easy for me to provide this in a simple way.








---WIREFRAMES---

Header – languages used – HTML, CSS, Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
Features:
1.	The logo – this is of course in the header, so it is on every page. It stays on the left side of the header.
2.	Nav Bar – I used bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) for this, for efficiency. Each button on the nav bar has a hover effect. The book now link, is a bootstrap danger button (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/buttons/) to stand out, with a hover effect.
3.	In mobile view, the logo before each nav title is not displayed. The logo and nav-links each have their own line.

Footer – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
Features:
1.	The Locations – the escape room has 3 locations that can be booked. Each location has the full address. When clicked, the link opens a new page to google maps with the location. This makes it easy for the consumer to find their way. In mobile view, the full location is not displayed, only the location name. 
2.	Contact us – an email and telephone number are on the footer, so it is on each page, for easy access by the consumer. The email has a link to your email app, to make contact easy for the consumer. The phone number will also link to the consumers phone app.
3.	Social links – each page must contain links to the business’s social media platforms, with a hover effect too.

Home page – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome https://fontawesome.com/)

Home page wireframe (desktop)

Home page wireframe (mobile)

Features 
1.	Background picture – An eye-catching background picture, with a horror themed escape room. I want to catch the consumers attention.

![slogan screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Slogan-screenshot.png "slogan screenshot")


2.	Slogan over the picture – Another link to the booking page here. An enticing question “Can you escape?”. This challenges the consumer to want to take on the challenge. In mobile view, this slogan covers the whole width of the screen. 
3.	Reviews – As is very important with business, there needs to be reviews from consumers. This gives other customers something to go by. Each review has a link to trip advisor, for them to read more reviews. Also, a star rating out of 5, in gold to stand out. Bootstrap row and cols were used here, to easily respond to other devices. In mobile view, these are placed one on top of the other. 

![reviews screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Reviews-screenshot.png "reviews screenshot")

4.	Room overview – The homepage should have a simple view of the rooms available. This is done as a carousel using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/), which I used to save time, and for a professional look. It will contain a picture of what the room is about, the room name, and its difficulty level.

Features to implement 
1.	I had the idea to add a sale bar just under the header, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep it simple.

Mobile View –

Features
1.	Room title – Each room name is in large text to stand out.
2.	Video – An embedded YouTube video with a trailer for each room, to show how exciting the room is. 
3.	Background story – Aligned to the right of the video, a block of text with a background story of the room. This gives the customers the idea of what the room theme is. It also shows the difficulty level, for beginners or experts. It also shows recommended number of players, and price. These are separated by a line break and a brighter colour to have the text stand out. 
4.	In mobile view - the video is above the text
5.  In mobile and tablet view - I used bootstrap flex behaviours to ensure the video div is placed above the text div on the second video on the page. On the desktop site, the text is before the video.
5.	Book Now – There is also a book now link in bright red (danger button from bootstrap) to again persuade the customer to book.

Features 
1.	The booking form – the form is for the customer to fill out using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/), which I used for efficiency. It asks for their details (name, email, and contact number). It also asks which room they would like to book, and the time and date. 
2.	Book Now – The submit button for the form is in bright red (danger button from bootstrap mentioned above). I have kept each book now link the same button, to keep it simple and effective.
3.	I have set certain requirements for the form:
•	Each field is required – it will not let you submit without filling each field
•	Email must have the correct format
•	The time of booking is only allowed to be selected during opening hours. 

Features to implement 
1.	I had the idea to add a sale bar just under the header, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep it simple.

Testing

I have used a group of 15 individuals that are of my target market. I have sent them the website, asked them to view it in laptop, mobile and tablet view and to give me feedback. I received fantastic feedback. 100% of the target group “loved” the website. Here is some of the feedback I received.

Aim - to attract customers to the website.

Was this achieved? - One of the customers said, “This website would stand out, it is simple, effective and easy to use”.

Aim - to ensure the website had an eye-catching homepage. 

Was this achieved? - 100% of the customers agreed that the homepage was eye-catching. The picture and slogan on the homepage, catches the attention of the consumer immediately. 

Aim - to make a simple, but effective website.

Was this achieved? - I wanted all my links to have a similar hover affect, to show consistency. The only hover that did not have the same affect was the book now links, which all had their own affect. All the visitors agreed that it was easy to navigate and to find what they were looking for. 

Aim - to give the visitor an experience of what the escape room is like. 

Was this achieved? - I did this by showing reviews from people that have used the room, showing they loved it, with a link to trip advisor for more reviews. The room page also shows video trailers of the rooms, with a background story to give the visitor an idea of what the room is about and which one they would enjoy the most. 

Aim – to make it easy to contact the company.

Was this achieved? - I made it very easy for the customer to find and contact the company, with external links to google maps, email, and phone app. Also, external links to each social media page at the footer on each page. 

Aim – for the visitor to remain on the page.

Was this achieved? – I did this by having all external links open up to a new tab. 

Aim – make the website responsive to all devices.

Was this achieved? I asked all the testers to view the website on laptop, mobile and tablets and in both portrait and landscape view. 100% of them agreed that it was responsive and were impressed with how certain aspects changed in mobile view. I have described above in each section; what changes occur in mobile view. 

Deployment

I regularly used Git Push to deploy this page to GitHub. Whenever I completed a page, fixed an error, or finished coding for the day, I would git commit and then git push.

I used the information in this webpage to create my GitHub pages site. https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

I used GitPod to write my code. 


Content

Part of the text for the background story for the room “Shipwrecked” was taken from Wikipedia link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Jack
