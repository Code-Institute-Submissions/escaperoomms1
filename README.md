Ali Sadiq MS1 - Escape Leeds

This is the first project of my software development career. I have decided to create a website for an Escape Room company named Escape Leeds.
I will be using what I have learnt from modules covering HTML, CSS and the bootstrap framework. I am going to be attempting to show a wide range
of parts I have learnt, from forms to hovers. 

-UX-

The website is for the company Escape Leeds. They are a west yorkshire based Escape Room business. They currently have 3 sites

in Leeds, which each have 3 rooms available for players. 

The site owner's goal is to atrract customers and convince them to complete a booking with their escape rooms.

The website targets thrill seeeking individuals who are either new to the escape room experience or have done them before.

My project is the best way for the site owner to achieve their goal as it's simple but effective. 

I have produced an eye-catching homepage, attracting the viewers attention. 

I also have encorporated customer reviews, to give new customers an idea as to how brilliant the experience will be. 

A simple footer on each page providing the address to each location and an external link showing the exact location on google maps, 
gives the consumer an easy way to be able to find how to get there.

The footer also has links to the social media pages of the site owner, which encourages them to further explore the business.

Having visited many escape rooms myself, in many different countries, I have had exposure to a lot of websites.

With me being a big fan of the rooms, I know exactly what the consumer wants, making it easy for me to provide this in a simple way.







---WIREFRAMES---

Header – languages used – HTML, CSS, Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
Features:
1.	The logo – this is of course in the header, so it is on every page. It stays on the left side of the header.
2.	Nav Bar – I used bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) for this, for efficiency. Each button on the nav bar has a hover effect. The book now link, is a bootstrap danger button (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/buttons/) to stand out, with a hover effect. 


Footer – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
Features:
1.	The Locations – the escape room has 3 locations that can be booked. Each location has the full address. When clicked, the link opens a new page to google maps with the location. This makes it easy for the consumer to find their way. 
2.	Contact us – an email and telephone number are on the footer, so it is on each page, for easy access by the consumer
3.	Social links – each page must contain links to the business’s social media platforms, with a hover effect too.

















Home page – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome https://fontawesome.com/)

 

Features 
1.	Background picture – An eye-catching background picture, with a horror themed escape room. I want to catch the consumers attention.

 
2.	Slogan over the picture – Another link to the booking page here. An enticing question “Can you escape?”. This challenges the consumer to want to take on the challenge.
3.	Reviews – As is very important with business, there needs to be reviews from consumers. This gives other customers something to go by. Each review has a link to trip advisor, for them to read more reviews. Also, a star rating out of 5, in gold to stand out. Bootstrap row and cols were used here, to easily respond to other devices. 

 
4.	Room overview – The homepage should have a simple view of the rooms available. This is done as a carousel using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/), which I used to save time, and for a professional look. It will contain a picture of what the room is about, the room name, and its difficulty level. 

 

Features to implement 
1.	I had the idea to add a sale bar just under the header, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep it simple.











Room Page – languages used – HTML, CSS

 

Features
1.	Room title – Each room name is in large text to stand out.
2.	Video – An embedded YouTube video with a trailer for each room, to show how exciting the room is. 
3.	Background story – Aligned to the right of the video, a block of text with a background story of the room. This gives the customers the idea of what the room theme is. It also shows the difficulty level, for beginners or experts. 
4.	Book Now – There is also a book now link in bright red (danger button from bootstrap) to again persuade the customer to book.
Booking page – languages used – HTML, CSS

 

Features 
1.	The booking form – the form is for the customer to fill out using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/), which I used for efficiency. It asks for their details (name, email, and contact number). It also asks which room they would like to book, and the time and date. 
2.	Book Now – The submit button for the form is in bright red (danger button from bootstrap mentioned above). I have kept each book now link the same button, to keep it simple and effective.






Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
