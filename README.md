Ali Sadiq MS1 - Escape Leeds

This is the first project of my software development career. I have decided to create a website for an Escape Room company named Escape Leeds.
I will be using what I have learnt from modules covering HTML, CSS and the bootstrap framework. I am going to be attempting to show a wide range
of parts I have learnt, from forms to hovers. 


-UX-

The website is for the company Escape Leeds. They are a west yorkshire based Escape Room business. They currently have 3 sites

in Leeds, which each have 3 rooms available for players. 

The site owner's goal is to atrract customers and convince them to complete a booking with their escape rooms.

The website targets thrill seeeking individuals who are either new to the escape room experience, or have done them before.

My project is the best way for the site owner to achieve their goal as it's simple but effective. 

I have produced an eye catching homepage, attracting the viewers attention. 

I also have encorporated customer reviews, to give new customers an idea as to how brilliant the experience will be. 

A simple footer on each page providing the address to each location and an external link showing the exact location on google maps, 
gives the consumer an easy way to be able to find how to get there.

The footer also has links to the social media pages of the site owner, which encourages them to further explore the business.

Having visited many escape rooms myself, in many different countries, I have had exposure to a lot of websites.

With me being a big fan of the rooms, I know exactly what the consumer wants, making it easy for me to provide this in a simple way.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

-Features-

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
