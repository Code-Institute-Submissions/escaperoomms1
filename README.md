Ali Sadiq MS1 - Escape Leeds

[View the live project here.](https://alisadiq91.github.io/escaperoomms1/index.html)

This is the first project of my software development career. I have decided tocreate a website for an Escape Room company named Escape Leeds.
I will be using what I have learnt from modules covering HTML, CSS and the 
bootstrap framework. I am going to be attempting to show a wide range
of parts I have learnt, from forms to hovers. 


The website is for the company Escape Leeds. They are a west yorkshire based Escape Room business. They currently have 3 sites in Leeds, which each have 3 
rooms available for players. 


-UX-User Stories-

•	First Time Visitor Goals

1.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be attracted to want to find out more, to learn what type of experience I can book.

2.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

3.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see reviews from other customers to have an idea of whether I will have a good experience.

4.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to access contact information easily and to locate the company’s social media. I also want to know the locations of the venues, to see if they are easily accessible to me.  

•	Returning Visitor Goals

1.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about which rooms are available, and the cost of these.

2.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to book the room I want in a simple way.

3.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to be able to see a taster of each room available, as a video or pictures.

•	Frequent User Goals

1.	As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added rooms or challenges. 


Having visited many escape rooms myself, in many different countries, I have 
had exposure to a lot of websites.

With me being a big fan of the rooms, I know exactly what the consumer wants, making it easy for me to provide this in a simple way.




---WIREFRAMES---

Header – languages used – HTML, CSS, Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
Features:
1.	The logo – this is of course in the header, so it is on every page. It stays on the left side of the header.
2.	Nav Bar – I used bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) for this, for efficiency. Each button on the nav bar has a hover effect. The book now link, is a bootstrap danger button (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/buttons/) to stand out, with a hover effect.
3.	In mobile view, the logo before each nav title is not displayed. The logo and nav-links each have their own line.  

![header screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Header-screenshot.png "header screenshot")


Footer – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
Features:
1.	The Locations – the escape room has 3 locations that can be booked. Each location has the full address. When clicked, the link opens a new page to google maps with the location. This makes it easy for the consumer to find their way. In mobile view, the full location is not displayed, only the location name. 
2.	Contact us – an email and telephone number are on the footer, so it is on each page, for easy access by the consumer. The email has a link to your email app, to make contact easy for the consumer. The phone number will also link to the consumers phone app.
3.	Social links – each page must contain links to the business’s social media platforms, with a hover effect too.

Home page – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome https://fontawesome.com/)

Home page wireframe (desktop)

Home page wireframe (mobile)
![home wireframe mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/HomeWireFrameMobile.jpg "Home wireframe mobile")


Features 
1.	Background picture – An eye-catching background picture, with a horror themed escape room. I want to catch the consumers attention.

![slogan screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Slogan-screenshot.png "slogan screenshot")


2.	Slogan over the picture – Another link to the booking page here. An enticing question “Can you escape?”. This challenges the consumer to want to take on the challenge. In mobile view, this slogan covers the whole width of the screen. 
3.	Reviews – As is very important with business, there needs to be reviews from consumers. This gives other customers something to go by. Each review has a link to trip advisor, for them to read more reviews. Also, a star rating out of 5, in gold to stand out. Bootstrap row and cols were used here, to easily respond to other devices. In mobile view, these are placed one on top of the other. 

![reviews screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Reviews-screenshot.png "reviews screenshot")

4.	Room overview – The homepage should have a simple view of the rooms available. This is done as a carousel using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/), which I used to save time, and for a professional look. It will contain a picture of what the room is about, the room name, and its difficulty level. 

![carousel screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alisadiq91/escaperoomms1/master/assets/images/Carousel-screenshot.png "carousel screenshot")


Features to implement 
1.	I had the idea to add a sale bar just under the header, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep it simple.

Mobile View –

Features
1.	Room title – Each room name is in large text to stand out.
2.	Video – An embedded YouTube video with a trailer for each room, to show how exciting the room is. 
3.	Background story – Aligned to the right of the video, a block of text with a background story of the room. This gives the customers the idea of what the room theme is. It also shows the difficulty level, for beginners or experts. It also shows recommended number of players, and price. These are separated by a line break and a brighter colour to have the text stand out. 
4.	In mobile view - the video is above the text
5.	Book Now – There is also a book now link in bright red (danger button from bootstrap) to again persuade the customer to book.

Features 
1.	The booking form – the form is for the customer to fill out using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/), which I used for efficiency. It asks for their details (name, email, and contact number). It also asks which room they would like to book, and the time and date. 
2.	Book Now – The submit button for the form is in bright red (danger button from bootstrap mentioned above). I have kept each book now link the same button, to keep it simple and effective.
3.	I have set certain requirements for the form:
•	Each field is required – it will not let you submit without filling each field
•	Email must have the correct format
•	The time of booking is only allowed to be selected during opening hours. 

Features to implement 
1.	I had the idea to add a sale bar just under the header, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep it simple.

Testing

HTML Validator

Home page - No errors - There is only warnings for empty headings which I felt appropriate to leave in, as they were edited in CSS for decorative purposes.

Deployment

I used GitPod to write my code.

I regularly used Git Push to deploy this page to GitHub. Whenever I completed a page, fixed an error, or finished coding for the day, I would git commit and then git push.

I used the information in this webpage to create my GitHub pages site. https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

The link above gave me the following steps. 

1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

2.	At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3.	Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4.	Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5.	The page will automatically refresh.

6.	Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

All content was written by the coder apart from those listed below and those pulled from bootstrap, for the header and carousel. 

Part of the text for the background story for the room “Shipwrecked” was taken from Wikipedia link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Jack
